The goal of this game is to gobble up as many apples (red squares) on the board 
while not crashing into yourself or the boundary. There are five stages, each with 
increasing speed. The snake itself grows with each apple it consumes, making it more 
difficult to consume the other apples without crashing. If all five stages are completed, 
the game is won and the user is declared a champion. Enjoy!
